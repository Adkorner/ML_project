# ML_Project

This repository contains all the necessary files for the heart disease prediction project using machine learning models.

## Files in the Repository:
1. **data.csv**: 
   - This file contains the dataset used for the project.
   - It includes clinical indicators and a binary target variable (1 for heart disease, 0 for no heart disease).
   - Ensure this file is in the same directory as the Jupyter Notebook when running the project.

2. **project.ipynb**:
   - A Jupyter Notebook that contains the entire project workflow.
   - Includes data preprocessing, model building (Logistic Regression and Neural Networks), hyperparameter tuning, PCA analysis, and model evaluation.
   - All necessary libraries and dependencies are listed and imported in the notebook.
